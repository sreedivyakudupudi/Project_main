Potato,Early blight,"Early blight of potato is caused by the fungus, Alternaria solani, which can cause disease in potato, tomato, other members of the potato family, and some mustards. This disease, also known as target spot, rarely affects young, vigorously growing plants. It is found on older leaves first. Early blight is favored by warm temperatures and high humidity.","Early blight can be minimized by maintaining optimum growing conditions, including proper fertilization, irrigation, and management of other pests. Grow later maturing, longer season varieties. Fungicide application is justified only when the disease is initiated early enough to cause economic loss.","Liquid Copper Spray -https://www.amazon.com/BONIDE-PRODUCTS-775-Fungicide-32-Ounce/dp/B016IVIJLG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Liquid+Copper+Spray&qid=1573678911&sr=8-2&linkCode=sl1&tag=planetnatur03-20&linkId=dd3de186832f49f2d228be1726fee688

Potato,Late blight,"1. Plant resistant cultivars when available.
2. Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.
3. Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day — avoid overhead irrigation.
4. Destroy all potato debris after harvest (see Fall Garden Cleanup).","Late blight is controlled by eliminating cull piles and volunteer potatoes, using proper harvesting and storage practices, and applying fungicides when necessary. Air drainage to facilitate the drying of foliage each day is important. Under marginal conditions, overhead sprinkler irrigation can favor late blight; in Tule Lake under solid set sprinklers, conditions conducive to late blight development are enhanced by day time irrigation but not night time irrigation.",Liquid Copper Spray -https://www.amazon.com/BONIDE-PRODUCTS-775-Fungicide-32-Ounce/dp/B016IVIJLG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Liquid+Copper+Spray&qid=1573678911&sr=8-2&linkCode=sl1&tag=planetnatur03-20&linkId=dd3de186832f49f2d228be1726fee688Sernade garden - https://www.amazon.sg/Agra-Quest-708510A-Serenade-32-Ounce/dp/B000FOMRUC,"Potato late blight is caused by the water mold pathogen Phytophthora infestans. This highly destructive disease thrives in cool, moist conditions, spreading rapidly through potato fields. The pathogen infects plant tissues, producing characteristic lesions on leaves, stems, and tubers. It spreads through spores, which can be carried by wind, water, or infected plant material. Late blight devastates potato crops by destroying foliage, reducing yield, and spoiling tubers. Timely detection and management strategies are crucial to mitigate its impact on potato production."
Tomato,Target Spot,"1.Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores.
2.Rotate crops and don’t plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year– primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course – tomatoes. Rutgers University Extension recommends a three year rotation cycle to reduce soil-borne fungi.
3.Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants aren’t crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil.
4.Water tomato plants in the morning so the leaves have time to dry. Water at the base of the plant or use a soaker hose or drip system to keep the leaves dry. Apply a mulch to keep the fruit from coming in direct contact with the soil. Limit mulch to 3 inches (8 cm.) or less if your plants are bothered by slugs or snails.","Crop Rotation: Avoid planting tomatoes in the same location consecutively to disrupt the disease cycle.
Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce the source of fungal spores.
Proper Plant Spacing: Ensure adequate spacing between tomato plants to promote air circulation and reduce humidity, which can inhibit fungal growth.
Early Detection: Regularly inspect plants for symptoms of target spot, such as circular lesions on leaves, and promptly remove and destroy infected plant parts.
Fungicide Application: In severe cases, consider applying fungicides labeled for target spot control following manufacturer's instructions and recommended intervals.","Chlorothalonil: https://kisandarshan.in/product/kavach-chlorothalonil-75-wp-fungicide/

This disease manifests as circular lesions on the leaves, resembling a target pattern, hence its name. These lesions can expand rapidly, leading to defoliation and reduced fruit quality and yield. Target spot thrives in warm and humid conditions, making it particularly problematic in regions with such climates. Effective management strategies include crop rotation, fungicide applications, and maintaining proper plant spacing to reduce humidity levels and minimize disease spread. Early detection and intervention are crucial for preventing severe outbreaks and safeguarding tomato production."

These viruses are highly stable and can survive in infected plant debris and soil for extended periods. The virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected plants, either mechanically or via insect vectors such as aphids and whiteflies. Humans can also inadvertently spread the virus by handling infected plants and then healthy ones without proper sanitation."
Tomato,Yellow Leaf Curl Virus,"There are two key points to managing the spread of TYLCV:
1. Do not move infected or host plants or seedlings, or infected SLW
2. Control SLW on farms, surrounding vegetation and seedling nurseries.
Good farm management and farm hygiene practices will help manage the spread of TYLCV:
1.Use seedling plants produced in an area free from virus and whiteflies
2. Destroy old crops as soon as possible after final harvest
3. Control SLW adults before destroying crops to reduce the migration of SLW to other crops
4. Plant new crops as far away as practicable from existing crops which may harbour the virus and its carrier, silverleaf whitefly
5. Control silverleaf whiteflies using appropriate chemicals, application methods and IPM strategies
maintain a high standard of weed control within and around crops to reduce hosts of both the virus and silverleaf whitefly.","1.Use resistant or tolerant varieties.
2. Plant early to avoid peak populations of the whitefly.
